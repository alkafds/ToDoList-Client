# ToDoList Client 

This todolist repository is the client-side web for the todolist project I've made.
It is made using React and Vite.
For this to run, make sure you have cloned the server repository and run it in another vscode instance.
And then, you can:
1. Clone this repository
2. install dependencies using ``npm install``
3. run the project using ``npm run dev``. make sure you have also run the server repo using the same command.
4. voila, its a simple to do list for you ready to use.

Packages used:
- Axios
- Chakra UI
- React
- React-DOM
- Vite
